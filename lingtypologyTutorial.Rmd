The lingtypology package can be used for many purposes. In this tutorial, we'll explore various features showing how the package can be used to a) gather data from Glottolog about the many languages of the world, b) showcase your research with interactive maps and clickable content and c) create teaching materials.

## 1. Installing and loading lingtypology

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
if (!require('lingtypology')) 
install.packages("lingtypology")
library(lingtypology)
```

## 2. Where is a particular language spoken?

```{r}
country.lang("Michif")
```

## 3. Which languages are spoken in a given country?

NOTE: There appears to be no data for Sweden (?)

```{r}
ausLang = lang.country("Australia")
length(ausLang) # returns the number of languages in our vector
head(ausLang) # returns the first few entries
```

## 4. Gathering data about a language

```{r}
gooniyandi = data.frame(subset(glottolog.original,language=="Gooniyandi"))
str(gooniyandi) # lists the variables in the data frame
```

## 5. Creating a data frame with all data for a specific country

We also remove rows in which all data columns are "NA" and limit our data frame to include the following variables: <br>
1. language <br>
2. family <br>
3. location <br>
4. language status <br>

Our data frame will be nice and tidy, but due to long strings within certain variables, it's difficult to inspect our data. We therefore write our data to a html table using xtable().

```{r}
za = data.frame(glottolog.original)
za = za[za$country=="South Africa",]
ind <- apply(za, 1, function(x) all(is.na(x)))
za <- za[ !ind, ]
za=za[,c(1,6,12,14)] # the column indices corresponding to the variables we want

if (!require('xtable')) 
install.packages("xtable")

library(xtable)
za=xtable(za)
print.xtable(za, type="html", file="za1.html")
```

## 6. Mapping the languages of a given country

We use our previously declared variable 'ausLang' to create an interactive map. Alternatively, we can use map.feature(lang.country("Australia")).

```{r}
map.feature(ausLang)
```

## 7. Mapping a set of languages with custom features

```{r}
myLanguages=c("Nyulnyul", "Warrwa", "Guugu Yimidhirr","Warlpiri","Gooniyandi")
myFeatures=c("accusative","unknown","neutral","unknown","accusative")
map.feature(myLanguages,myFeatures)
```

## 8. Mapping a language using custom coordinates

We will also add the following features: <br>
1. zoom control <br>
2. zoom level <br>
3. a minimap <br>
4. pop-up text <br>

```{r}
map.feature("Gooniyandi",
            label="Gooniyandi", 
            minimap=T, #logical value, True or False (or T/F), False by default
            zoom.control=T, 
            zoom.level=3,
            popup="You can add additional info here <br>another line with info",
            latitude = -19, 
            longitude = 125)
```

## 9. Adding a pop-up video to a map

This feature could be useful for field linguists who would like to add a short video introduction to a language they're documenting, maybe even from the field. The particular video in this example is unrelated to Gooniyandi and only intended to illustrate the idea.

```{r}
video="https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/13/48600.mp4"
video= paste("<video width='200' height='150' controls> <source src='",
                         as.character(video),
                         "' type='video/mp4'></video>", sep = "")
map.feature("Gooniyandi",popup=video,zoom.level=4)
```

## 10. Changing the map type

There are several map types available. See them here: 
https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html

By adding the control parameter, we can also create a map with two layers to choose from.

```{r}
map.feature("Swedish", tile =c("OpenTopoMap","Stamen.Watercolor"),control=T, zoom.level=4)
```
<br>
The world at night. This map and the next seem to not show unless we specify a zoom level.
<br>
```{r}
map.feature("Swedish", tile ="NASAGIBS.ViirsEarthAtNight2012",zoom.level=5)
```
<br>
My personal favourite..
<br>
```{r}
map.feature("Swedish", tile ="Thunderforest.SpinalMap",zoom.level = 5)
```

## 11. Mapping members of a language family

We will map the Khoisan languages and add a density contour.

```{r}
map.feature(lang.aff("Khoisan"),density.estimation = TRUE)
```
<br>
And if we only want the area without points..
<br>
```{r}
map.feature(lang.aff("Khoisan"),density.estimation = TRUE,density.points = FALSE)
```

## 12. Mapping two language families

Mapping two language families gets slightly more tricky and requires a bit of coding. <br>
1. We first gather the languages belonging to Khoisan and Bantu.<br>
2. Because the aff.lang variable contains many details, we use grepl() to search the strings of text for "Bantu" and "Khoisan" and assign these labels in a new variable we call "family". <br>
3. We then join the individual languages with their family labels in a data frame. <br>
4. As a bonus, we add coordinates to our data. <br>
5. Lastly, we remove the redundant row names. <br>

```{r, warning=F}
language=lang.aff(c("Khoisan","Bantu")) # Step 1
family=aff.lang(language) # this is an extra step needed for this document to work
family[grepl("Bantu",aff.lang(language))==T]="Bantu" # Step 2
family[grepl("Khoisan",aff.lang(language))==T]="Khoisan"
africa=data.frame(language,family) # Step 3
africa$long=long.lang(africa$language) # Step 4
africa$lat=lat.lang(africa$language) 
rownames(africa) <- c() # Step 5
head(africa)
table(africa$family)
```
<br>
We can now plot our data.
<br>
```{r}
map.feature(africa$language,
            features=africa$family,
            longitude = africa$long,
            latitude = africa$lat,
            density.estimation = africa$family)
```
<br>
We can also create the same map with a few modifications.
<br>
```{r, warning=F}
map.feature(africa$language,
            features=africa$family,
            longitude = africa$long,
            latitude = africa$lat,
            density.estimation =africa$family,
            density.longitude.width = 8,
            density.latitude.width = 8,
            color=c("red","blue"),
            density.estimation.opacity=0.3,
            density.estimation.color = c("red","blue"),
            zoom.level=4,
            zoom.control = T)
```

## 13. Getting data from typological databases

We can download and use data from the following sources:
<br>
1. WALS <br>
2. AUTOTYP <br>
3. PHOIBLE <br>
4. Affix borrowing database <br>
5. South American indigenous language structures <br>
6. Austronesian basic vocabulary database <br>

As an example, lets map Matt Dryer's basic word order data (WALS feature 81a).


```{r, warning=F}
wordOrder <- wals.feature(c("81a"))
head(wordOrder)

map.feature(wordOrder$language,
            features = wordOrder$`81a`,
            latitude = wordOrder$latitude,
            longitude = wordOrder$longitude,
            label = wordOrder$language,
            title = "Word Order",
            control=T,
            zoom.control = T)
```

## 14. Mapping predictions about linguistic features

This is a very simple example of a machine learning approach to predicting typological features. In this case, we will use the decision tree algorithm for classification to predict word order from geographical coordinates. We could of course apply more sophisticated methods with model evaluation and include other predictor variables from e.g. WALS and Glottolog to optimize our model. However for our purposes, we will only consider longitude and latitude.

```{r}
library(rpart) # rpart is included in base R, but needs to be loaded

# We first merge our previously defined wordOrder data frame with Glottolog data.
# Our old wordOrder data frame is replaced by the new data frame
wordOrder=merge(glottolog.original,wordOrder)

# We then add a new column with word order data as a factor variable
wordOrder$wo=factor(wordOrder$`81a`)

# Now we can split our data into a training and a test set
set.seed(43282) #this allows for reproducibility of the analysis
smp_size <- round(0.7 * nrow(wordOrder)) #our training data will contain 70% of the rows
train_ind <- sample(seq_len(nrow(wordOrder)), size = smp_size) #choosing a random sample of row numbers
train <- wordOrder[train_ind, ]
test <- wordOrder[-train_ind, ] # the test set contains the rows not included in the training set

# We fit our simple model on the training set
fit <- rpart(wo ~ longitude+latitude,
             method="class", data=train,na.action = na.exclude)

# Based on our fitted model, we can assign the predicted word orders to a new variable 
# and add it to our test data frame
test$pred=predict(fit,test,type="class")

# We then create another column that tells us whether individual predictions were correct or not
# The logical operator '==' means "is equal to", compares two values and returns TRUE if values match
# '!=' means "is not equal to"
test$correct[test$pred==test$wo]="Correct"
test$correct[test$pred!=test$wo]="Incorrect"
test$correct=factor(test$correct)

# How many correct/incorrect predictions?
table(test$correct)
cat("in percent: ", prop.table(table(test$correct))*100)

# Relative importance of our variables
fit$variable.importance
cat("Scaled to 100: ", fit$variable.importance/sum(fit$variable.importance)*100)
```

We now have a good idea about our model's performance. Let's create a map revealing correct and incorrect test predictions.

```{r}
map.feature(languages=test$language,
            features=test$correct,
            color=c("green","red"),
            minimap=T,
            zoom.control=T,
            popup = paste("actual: ",test$wo,"<br>","predicted: ",test$pred))
```

## 15. Mapping links between languages on an interactive globe
In this last part, we map data gathered with lingtypology onto an interactive 3d map of the world and create links between coordinates. Among many other things, this can be used to map geographical dispersal between related languages. In this example, we map links between Danish and other Germanic languages, as well as links between all members of the Cree languages.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
if (!require('threejs')) 
install.packages("threejs")
library(threejs)

# A picture of the earth which we'll turn into a globe
earth <- "http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/73000/73909/world.topo.bathy.200412.3x5400x2700.jpg"

# We create data frame with all Germanic languages and coordinates
language=lang.aff("Germanic")
Danish=data.frame(language,
                   lat=lat.lang(language),
                   long=long.lang(language))

# We do a bit of cleaning, though it may not be strictly necessary
Danish=subset(Danish,language="Danish") #remove Danish
Danish=na.omit(Danish) #unfortunately, some of thee languages do not have 
# coordinates, including Norwegian
rownames(Danish)=c() #not necessary, but the row names are redundant

# Similarly for Cree
language=lang.aff("Cree")
Cree=data.frame(language,
                  lat=lat.lang(language),
                  long=long.lang(language))
rownames(Cree)=c()

# Combining into one data frame
DanCree=data.frame(rbind(Danish,Cree))

# Assigning coordinates to create links between Danish and other Germanic languages
coordsDan=cbind(rep(lat.lang("Danish",nrow(Danish))), # column 1: latitude location 1
           rep(long.lang("Danish",nrow(Danish))), # column 2: longitude location 1
           Danish$lat, # column 3: latitude location 2
           Danish$long) # column 4: longitude location 2

# For Cree 
language=lang.aff("Cree")
linkCree=data.frame(expand.grid(l1=language,l2=language))
linkCree=subset(linkCree,l1!=l2) 
linkCree=linkCree[!duplicated(t(apply(linkCree,1,sort))),] #remove repeated pairs
coordsCree=cbind(lat.lang(linkCree$l1),
                 long.lang(linkCree$l1),
                 lat.lang(linkCree$l2),
                 long.lang(linkCree$l2))

coords=rbind(coordsDan,coordsCree)

globejs(img = earth, 
        lat = DanCree$lat, 
        long =DanCree$long,
        arcs=coords,
        arcsColor="gold",
        value=20,
        color="red",
        arcsOpacity = 0.6,
        arcsHeight = 0.4,
        arcsLwd = 4,
        atmosphere=T)
```
